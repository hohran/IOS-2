# IOS Projekt 2

Pls don't copy, this is meant for study purposes only.

## Functionality

The code should be ok, sometimes it doesn't need to be so overhyped (atoi instead of strtol etc.), but I still had some functions from IJC projects xd.
When I tested it on merlin, it still had some leaks of unterminated processes tho:/ but on Ubuntu it worked flawlessly imo.

## Contribute

If you spot any mistakes, contact me pls so others won't study some nonsense.
Hope it will serve you well.
